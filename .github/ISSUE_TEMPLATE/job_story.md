# Job Story

Please describe what you are trying to achieve in the form of a job story.

A job story *may* be preferable to an user story if the user who carries out the action is not distinct.
In these cases the expected outcome is *likely* to be more important than the user who might carry out the action.

A Job story *may* also be more preferable if the story describes a machine to machine interaction that is triggered by an event
In this case the "I" in the story should be replaced by a hostname.

A job story an always be rewritten into a User Story and vice versa.

The job story should follow the following format: 

***When [SITUATION], I want to [MOTIVATION] so I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME].***

Where:

* SITUATION is a description of the context when the job story applies. (or of what event has occurred).
* MOTIVATION is a description of what the user wants. Think of this as the users goal.
* EXPECTED OUTCOME describes what the uses expects to see as a result. Think of this as the "why"

* **N: Negotiable** The scope of the story should be able to variable and negotiable with the developers. i.e. there should be many way to satisfy the story.
* **V: Valuable** The story must have a clear and quantifiable value to the business. This can be specified informally as high/medium/low and should impact multiple layerrs in the system.
* **E: Estimable** The user story must be concrete enough allow the developers to estimate it. It must not be an open ended requirement.
* **S: Small** The story must be small, enough that a version if it can be completed within a single sprint iteration. Larger stories must be split into smaller ones.
* **T: Testable** The business should be able to describe the tests required that will validate the sort has been completed. See the [Acceptance Tests](#acceptance-tests) and [Examples](#examples) section below.
