# User Story

As a [WHO}, I want [WANT], so that [BUSINESS VALUE]

Where:

* WHO is the role or user persona who carries out the action. Try not to use "User"
* WANT is a description of what is desired or needed or the desired outcome or feature. The word "want" can replaced with "required", "need" or similar provided what is wanted is clear.
* BUSINESS VALUE describes the "why". The so-that clause of a story is important because understanding why a user wants what is described in the what portion of the story helps the team decide how best to implement the functionality.

The "so that" clause is option only if it adds no value. It almost all circumstances it should be present.
