# User Story

Please describe what you are trying to achieve in the form of a user story.
The user story should follow the following 

***As a [WHO}, I want [WANT], so that [BUSINESS VALUE].***

Where:

* WHO is the role or user persona who carries out the action. Try not to use "User"
* WANT is a description of what is desired or needed or the desired outcome or feature. The word "want" can replaced with "required", "need" or similar provided what is wanted is clear.
* BUSINESS VALUE describes the "why". The so-that clause of a story is important because understanding why a user wants what is described in the what portion of the story helps the team decide how best to implement the functionality.

The "so that" clause is option only if it adds no value. It almost all circumstances it should be present.

* **V: Valuable** The story must have a clear and quantifiable value to the business. This can be specified informally as high/medium/low and should impact multiple layerrs in the system.
* **E: Estimable** The user story must be concrete enough allow the developers to estimate it. It must not be an open ended requirement.
* **S: Small** The story must be small, enough that a version if it can be completed within a single sprint iteration. Larger stories must be split into smaller ones.
* **T: Testable** The business should be able to describe the tests required that will validate the sort has been completed. See the [Acceptance Tests](#acceptance-tests) and [Examples](#examples) section below.
